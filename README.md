#Project Objective:
To develop a program to plan shortest ship routes in shallow water areas using a graphical interface.

#Project Description:
The project is a GUI program designed to visualize and plan the shortest route of a ship through a water area, taking into account the depth of the terrain and the draft of the ship. 

Through the interface, the user creates a map of size NxN, specifying the size of the map as well as the draft of their ship.

The program, using the least path algorithm, takes into account the depth of the terrain and the draft of the ship. The result is a visualized shortest path from the top left corner of the map to the bottom right corner, which provides the captain with a clear idea of the optimal path.

The program interface is designed using the NumPy library for data processing and Matplotlib for map visualization.
